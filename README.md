## Description

**This is a concept project surrounding the idea of helping those with gambling addictions or those who are just curious about what chance they have of winning the lottery will be.**

## Challenges I Anticipate

**I expect to run into many problems involving research, in which I have to find all the information I can and the best solution possible towards helping others get over their addiction. Making an useful website that anyone can go to and benifit from is the true purpose of this projcet after all.**

## Skateboard
**Html Semantics, and well written article about the damamges of gambling.**

## Bike
**Make demo pages for all games, and then work on slots until complete. Figure out better ways to help those struggling with gambling, by conducting more research and creating a lock system.** 

## Car
**All games are completed, and you are able to help people get over their gambling addiction** 


## Personal Achievement Goals:

1. Learn everything I can about a forgien topic: in this case being gambling addictions
2. Create an attractive way for people to want to use my site, as well as benifite from continuos use
3. Prove to myself that I can solve a real world problem with technology if I really put my mind to it. I would also like proof that my site actaully help those that it is made for.
